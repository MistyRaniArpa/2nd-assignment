                    <p>Neymar—a slender-framed 5-foot 9-inch (1.75-metre) forward—was supremely confident on the
                        field,
                        with excellent body control, quick reflexes, and explosive speed. He made his first team
                        debut
                        with Santos in 2009. While playing with Santos, he averaged a goal every other match and
                        helped
                        the team win the Libertadores Cup (the most prestigious South American club competition) in
                        2011. Neymar’s many individual honours with Santos included the South American Footballer of
                        the
                        Year title in 2011 and 2012.</p>

                        his
